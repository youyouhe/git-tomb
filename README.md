## 🪦 What is this place?

Git Tomb is a **digital graveyard** for abandoned GitHub repositories. Because every side project deserves a proper burial, not just to rot in a dusty `git log`.

**Why?** Because we've all been there — started a "next big thing" with ✨ and abandoned it 3 days later when the dopamine wore off. This is the place to give those code corpses a final resting place.

## ⚰ How to Bury Your Dead Code

Found a repository that's been dead for 6+ months? Don't let it haunt your GitHub profile. Send it here.

### Quick Steps

1. **Clone & Open**

   cd git-tomb
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Configure AI Priest**
   - Go to Settings (gear icon)
   - Pick your AI provider (Gemini, OpenAI, DeepSeek)
   - Paste your API key (we don't store it — localStorage only)

3. **Start Burying**
   - Click "🪦 葬礼" (Bury Ceremony)
   - Paste the GitHub repo URL
   - The AI Priest will write a eulogy for the deceased
   - Fill in the epitaph and death cause
   - **Rest in peace.**

## 📝 Death Causes (Be Honest)

Pick the real reason why it died:

- 🎯 **Lost Interest** — 3-minute passion syndrome
- 💸 **No Market** — Zero users (built it anyway)
- 🌱 **Life Happened** — You touched grass
- 🍝 **Shiny Object** — Distracted by new framework (again)
- 🔗 **Dependency Hell** — Crushed by `node_modules`
- 🏗️ **Feature Creep** — Bloated to death
- 🤖 **AI Replaced It** — ChatGPT wrote it better in 30 seconds
- 📉 **Flopped** — Shipped but nobody cared
- ...and more
